            Where did we come from?
            Why are we here?
            Where do we go when we die?
            What lies beyond
            And what lay before?
            Is anything certain in life?
            They say, life is too short
            The here and the now
            And you're only given one shot
            But could there be more
            Have I lived before
            Or could this be all that we've got?
            <strong>If I die tomorrow
            I'd be all right
            Because I believe
            That after we're gone
            The spirit carries on </strong>
            I used to be frightened of dying
            I used to think death was the end
            But that was before
            I'm not scared anymore
            I know that my soul will transcend
            I may never find all the answers
            I may never understand why
            I may never prove
            What I know to be true
            But I know that I still have to try
            <strong>If I die tomorrow
            I'd be alright
            Because I believe
            That after we're gone
            The spirit carries on </strong>
            Move on, be brave
            Don't weep at my grave
            Because I am no longer here
            But please never let
            Your memory of me disappear
            Safe in the light that surrounds me
            Free of the fear and the pain
            My questioning mind
            Has helped me to find
            The meaning in my life again
            Victoria's real
            I finally feel
            At peace with the girl in my dreams
            And now that I'm here
            It's perfectly clear
            I found out what all of this means
            <strong>If I die tomorrow
            I'd be alright </strong>
            Because I believe
            That after we're gone
            The spirit carries on
